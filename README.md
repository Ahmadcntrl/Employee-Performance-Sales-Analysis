# 📊 Employee Performance & Sales Analysis: Project Overview
This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between workforce metrics (headcount, training, and performance) and business outcomes (store sales). Below are the key insights derived from the data.

## 1. Workforce Health & Retention
- High Turnover Risk: While the total headcount stands at 7.09K, there is a significant 31.6% Year-over-Year (YoY) increase in turnover. This suggests a potential retention crisis that needs immediate investigation.

- Departmental Attrition: The Store Operations department is the primary driver of exits (approx. 568 leavers), followed by Logistics/Warehousing. HR and Finance have the lowest turnover, suggesting the issue is concentrated in frontline, high-volume roles.

## 2. Training & Performance Correlation
- Positive Impact of Training: The "Training Impact on Team Performance" scatter plot shows a clear positive correlation. Teams that engage in higher levels of training consistently achieve higher average performance ratings (scaling from 3.6 to 3.9).

- Performance Stability: The average performance rating is steady at 3.7, with a slight YoY improvement of 0.75%. However, the "Performance Rating Trend" line chart shows a noticeable dip mid-year (around July/August) before recovering in Q4.

## 3. Financials & Sales Efficiency
- Sales Targets Met: The organization achieved $1.98bn in actual store sales, narrowly exceeding the target of $1.978bn (100.06% achievement).

- Bonus Structure: Bonus as a percentage of salary is 3.45%. Interestingly, the "Total Monthly Bonus" has surged by 48.17% YoY, indicating either a change in commission structure or higher performance payouts despite the turnover issues.

- Cost Management: Total salary cost is $204M, with a wide pay gap between the minimum ($8.82K) and maximum ($177.87K) salaries.

## 4. Geographic Store Performance
- Regional Concentration: The map reveals a heavy store concentration in the Eastern and Southern United States.

- Bottom Performers: The "Bottom Stores by Sales" chart identifies specific locations (like Austin, Baltimore, and Columbus) that are underperforming, with sales hovering around the $5.9M - $6.1M mark. These should be prioritized for operational audits.

## 💡 Recommendations
- Retention Strategy: Conduct stay interviews within Store Operations to understand the 31.6% turnover spike.

- Scale Training: Given the proven correlation between training and performance, increasing training budgets for mid-performing teams could yield a direct ROI in sales.

- Investigate July Slump: Analyze why performance ratings dip in July—this could be due to seasonal burnout or staffing shortages during peak summer months.
